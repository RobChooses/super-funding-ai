# ðŸ¤– SUPER FUNDING-AI

ðŸ’° Project Entry to ETHGlobal Superhack 2024

## Description of Project

SUPER FUNDING-AI allows anyone on Celo Minipay app to raise funding for investment, particularly first-time entrepreneurs, people seeking microfunding, and even web3 DAO treasuries. A problem for many of these groups is a lack of track record and investment history, and investors are wary of putting funds into projects in one go. SUPER Funding-AI allows investment to be split into stages with funds released upon conditions being met. To avoid any bias, these conditions are verified using an AI LLM which makes attestations on-chain wia EAS.
